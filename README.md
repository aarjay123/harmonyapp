To install Harmony on your Android device, please follow these steps:

1.  **Download the Latest APK:** Open a web browser on your Android device and navigate to the [latest releases page](https://github.com/aarjay123/harmonyapp/releases/latest) to download the most recent **.apk file**.
2.  **Access Downloaded File:** Open your device's file management application (such as the built-in "Files" app or Google Files). Locate the **Downloads** folder and tap the downloaded **.apk file**.
3.  **Enable Unknown Sources (if prompted):** If you haven't previously installed applications from outside the Google Play Store, your device may prompt you to allow installation from "Unknown Apps." Follow the on-screen instructions to enable this permission for your file management application.
4.  **Initiate Installation:** Once the necessary permissions are granted, the system will ask if you wish to install or update Harmony. Tap **Install** to proceed.
5.  **Enjoy Harmony:** Upon successful installation, you can find the Harmony icon in your app drawer and begin using the application.

### MacOS Installation Guide

1.  **Download the Latest ZIP:** On your MacOS device, open this website and download the latest **harmony-macos.zip** file from the releases tab ([here](https://github.com/aarjay123/harmonyapp/releases/latest)).
2.  **Unzip the File:** Once downloaded, unzip the file. This will create a new folder containing the Harmony MacOS Application file.
3.  **Move to Applications:** Drag and drop the **Harmony file** into your **Applications** folder.
